# Architecting a Tier-1 Quant Portfolio for 2026

## Introduction

This document outlines a portfolio of four interconnected projects designed to showcase a comprehensive skill set for quantitative finance. The projects cover the full quant trading stack, from systems architecture and high-performance computing to machine learning and decentralized finance. The goal is to demonstrate a holistic, systems-level thinking that is the hallmark of a top-tier quantitative professional.

The four projects are:
* **Aether:** A high-performance, event-driven backtesting engine.
* **Photon:** A GPU-accelerated engine for pricing and managing the risk of derivatives.
* **Nexus:** An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for generating alpha.
* **Helios:** An optimal strategy for providing liquidity in DeFi markets using deep reinforcement learning.

These projects are designed to be interwoven. For instance, alpha signals from "Nexus" can be tested in "Aether," and the high-performance computing techniques from "Photon" can accelerate the model training in "Nexus."

## 1. Project "Aether": A High-Performance, Event-Driven Backtesting Engine

### 1.1. Vision and Goal

* **Name:** Aether, evoking a fundamental medium where all market events happen.
* **Strategic Goal:** To build an architecturally sound backtesting engine that balances the speed needed for research with the fidelity required for validation. This demonstrates a mature understanding of the practical challenges in professional quant research.

### 1.2. Architectural Blueprint

The project will implement a **hybrid architecture** that leverages the strengths of both vectorized and event-driven backtesting. The core strategy logic will be abstracted, allowing it to be run on two different backends:
* A fast **VectorizedEngine** (using Python with Pandas/NumPy) for rapid idea generation and parameter sweeping.
* A high-fidelity **EventDrivenEngine** (using C++/Rust) for final validation and pre-production testing.

#### Comparison of Backtesting Architectures

| Feature | Vectorized Backtesting | Event-Driven Backtesting |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Mechanic** | Batch processing of data arrays. Calculates signals and P&L for all time steps at once. | Sequential processing of discrete events (Market, Signal, Order, Fill) in a chronological loop. |
| **Speed** | Extremely fast for simple strategies. | Inherently slower due to its serial, looped nature. |
| **Fidelity** | Low. Struggles to model intraday logic, complex order types, or market friction. | High. Can be customized to model market friction in great detail. |
| **Lookahead Bias** | High risk due to potential for indexing errors. | Extremely low risk, as the strategy only sees data up to the current event. |
| **Code Reusability** | Low. Requires a rewrite for live trading. | High. The architecture allows for a seamless transition to live trading. |
| **Primary Use Case** | Rapid prototyping and research on low-frequency strategies. | Rigorous validation, especially for intraday and complex strategies. |

### 1.3. Core Components (Event-Driven)

The event-driven engine will be modular and object-oriented:
* **Event Queue:** A FIFO queue that stores and processes events in chronological order to prevent lookahead bias.
* **Event Hierarchy:** A base `Event` class with subclasses for `MarketEvent`, `SignalEvent`, `OrderEvent`, and `FillEvent`.
* **Data Handler:** An abstract component for sourcing market data (from CSV, databases, or live APIs).
* **Strategy:** Encapsulates the trading logic, generating `SignalEvents` from `MarketEvents`.
* **Portfolio Handler:** Manages the portfolio's state (cash, positions), converting `SignalEvents` to `OrderEvents` based on risk and position sizing rules.
* **Execution Handler:** Simulates interaction with a brokerage, modeling market friction like slippage, commissions, and latency.
* **Main Loop:** A `while` loop that drives the simulation by pulling events from the queue and routing them to the appropriate handlers.

### 1.4. Technology Stack

* **Core Engine:** C++20 or Rust for maximum performance and memory safety.
* **Python Bindings:** `pybind11` (for C++) or `Py03` (for Rust) to create a hybrid system with a high-performance core and a flexible Python layer for strategy development.
* **Data Serialization:** Protocol Buffers or FlatBuffers for efficient storage and I/O of market data.
* **Orchestration (Advanced):** Apache Airflow for managing large-scale hyperparameter optimization tasks.

### 1.5. Development Roadmap

1.  **Phase 1 (Vectorized Prototype):** Build a simple vectorized backtester in Python (Pandas/NumPy) for a single asset.
2.  **Phase 2 (Core Engine):** Implement the event-driven components (Events, Queue, Handlers) in C++/Rust with comprehensive unit tests.
3.  **Phase 3 (First Event-Driven Backtest):** Wire the components together. Implement basic CSV data handling and simulated execution.
4.  **Phase 4 (Enhancing Realism):** Improve the `SimulatedExecutionHandler` with models for variable slippage and complex order types (limit, stop-loss).
5.  **Phase 5 (Python Integration):** Create Python bindings for the core engine.
6.  **Phase 6 (Analysis & Visualization):** Develop a Python reporting module to generate performance reports with key metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown) and equity curves.

## 2. Project "Photon": A GPU-Accelerated Derivatives Pricing and Risk Engine

### 2.1. Vision and Goal

* **Name:** Photon, drawing a parallel to the Monte Carlo method's simulation of countless "particles" of possibility.
* **Strategic Goal:** To demonstrate mastery of GPU programming (CUDA) by applying it to a computationally intensive financial problem: building a high-throughput risk engine for pricing derivatives and calculating their sensitivities (Greeks) for large portfolios.

### 2.2. Foundations

The project will start with the **Black-Scholes model** for European options, which has a closed-form solution and is easily parallelizable. It will then move to the **Monte Carlo method** to price path-dependent exotic options (e.g., Barrier options), which lack analytical solutions and are computationally expensive, making them ideal for GPU acceleration.

### 2.3. HPC Architecture with CUDA

The Monte Carlo method is "embarrassingly parallel," as each price path simulation is independent. This project will use **NVIDIA's CUDA platform**.
* **Core Logic:** A CUDA **kernel** (a C++ function executed in parallel by many GPU threads) will be the heart of the pricer. Each thread will be responsible for simulating one complete price path.
* **Random Numbers:** The **cuRAND** library will be used for high-performance, parallel random number generation, which is critical for correct and efficient simulation.
* **Aggregation:** A **parallel reduction** algorithm will be implemented on the GPU to efficiently sum the payoffs from all simulated paths.

### 2.4. Implementation: Pricing and Greeks

The core implementation will be a CUDA kernel for pricing a **Barrier Option**.
* **Advanced Goal (High-Performance Greeks):** The project will go beyond a simple pricer to calculate risk sensitivities (Greeks). Instead of the wasteful "bump-and-revalue" method, it will implement the more sophisticated **Pathwise Derivative Method**. This allows for the calculation of the option's price, Delta, and Vega simultaneously within a single, unified CUDA kernel, demonstrating a deep, practical knowledge of computational finance.

### 2.5. Technology Stack

| Library | Primary Use Case | Performance | Ease of Use | Key Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C++/CUDA** | Production-grade, high-performance kernels. | Highest possible. | High effort. | The industry standard for performance-critical code. |
| **Numba (`@cuda.jit`)** | Rapidly prototyping Python functions on the GPU. | Very good. | Very easy. | Seamless integration into Python code with a simple decorator. |
| **CuPy** | GPU-accelerated replacement for NumPy/SciPy. | Excellent. | Easy. | `RawKernel` feature for embedding native CUDA C++ code in Python. |
| **PyTorch/TensorFlow**| Building and training deep learning models. | Good. | Easy. | Built-in automatic differentiation (autograd) engine for easily calculating gradients (Greeks). |

### 2.6. Development Roadmap

1.  **Phase 1 (CPU Reference):** Implement a Monte Carlo pricer for European and Barrier options on the CPU in C++ or Python for baseline validation.
2.  **Phase 2 (Simple GPU Pricer):** Write a "hello world" CUDA kernel to calculate the analytical Black-Scholes formula for a large batch of options.
3.  **Phase 3 (GPU Monte Carlo Pricer):** Port the Barrier option pricer to a CUDA kernel, focusing on `cuRAND`, optimal memory access, and parallel reduction.
4.  **Phase 4 (GPU Analytical Greeks):** Implement CUDA kernels to calculate the analytical Greeks of the Black-Scholes model.
5.  **Phase 5 (Advanced - GPU Pathwise Greeks):** Modify the Barrier option kernel to simultaneously calculate price, Delta, and Vega using the Pathwise Derivative Method.
6.  **Phase 6 (Python Wrapper):** Wrap the final C++/CUDA engine with `pybind11` and build a simple interactive interface (e.g., with Streamlit).

## 3. Project "Nexus": An ML-Powered Alpha Generation Pipeline

### 3.1. Vision and Goal

* **Name:** Nexus, signifying the convergence of data, machine learning, and actionable trading signals.
* **Strategic Goal:** To build an end-to-end pipeline that mirrors the workflow of a modern quant researcher: from data ingestion and feature engineering to training sophisticated deep learning models and rigorously evaluating their output as a financial alpha factor.

### 3.2. The Alpha Generation Workflow

This project focuses on "alpha mining," a structured process that goes beyond simple price prediction.
1.  **Data Sourcing:** Use daily market data (OHLCV) and fundamental data (e.g., P/E, P/B ratios).
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Create a wide array of features, including technical indicators, volatility measures, and fundamental ratios.
3.  **Target Definition:** Define a robust target, such as the risk-adjusted, cross-sectionally ranked forward return of a stock over the next month.
4.  **Model Training:** Compare two powerful sequence architectures: **LSTMs** and **Transformers**.
5.  **Factor Evaluation:** Use tools like **Alphalens** to rigorously evaluate the model's predictions as an "alpha factor," analyzing its Information Coefficient (IC), quantile returns, and turnover.
6.  **Backtesting:** Use the validated alpha factor to drive a trading strategy in the "Aether" backtester.

### 3.3. Deep Dive: LSTMs vs. Transformers

This project will compare the legacy LSTM architecture with the state-of-the-art Transformer architecture, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of their trade-offs for financial time series.

| Feature | LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) | Transformer |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Mechanism** | Recurrent neural network with gated cells that processes data sequentially. | Feed-forward architecture based on a self-attention mechanism that processes the entire sequence at once. |
| **GPU Parallelization** | Inherently limited due to its sequential nature. | Extremely high, as it is based on parallelizable matrix multiplications. |
| **Long-Range Dependencies**| Prone to "forgetting" over long sequences as information must pass through every intermediate step. | Excellent at capturing long-range dependencies via direct, constant-time paths between any two points. |
| **Primary Use Case** | Legacy time series analysis with moderate sequence lengths. | State-of-the-art for complex, long-horizon time series forecasting where context is critical. |

The Transformer is positioned as a fundamentally more expressive tool for modeling the complex, non-linear nature of financial markets.

### 3.4. Technology Stack

* **ML Frameworks:** PyTorch or TensorFlow.
* **GPU-Accelerated Data Processing:** RAPIDS `cuDF` to accelerate the feature engineering pipeline, which is often a bottleneck.
* **Inference Optimization (Advanced):** NVIDIA TensorRT to optimize the trained model for high-performance inference, a strong signal of production-oriented thinking.
* **Quant Libraries:** `Alphalens` for factor analysis and `TA-Lib` for technical indicators.

### 3.5. Development Roadmap

1.  **Phase 1 (Data Pipeline):** Build a robust data pipeline using `cuDF` for data ingestion, cleaning, and feature engineering.
2.  **Phase 2 (Baseline Model):** Implement and train an LSTM model using proper walk-forward cross-validation.
3.  **Phase 3 (SOTA Model):** Implement and train a Transformer-based model for the same task.
4.  **Phase 4 (Factor Analysis):** Use `Alphalens` to generate detailed "tear sheets" comparing the predictive quality of the LSTM and Transformer factors.
5.  **Phase 5 (Strategy Backtesting):** Integrate the superior alpha factor into the "Aether" engine to run a long-short portfolio strategy.
6.  **Phase 6 (Deployment Simulation):** Convert the final model to the standard ONNX format and then use NVIDIA TensorRT to optimize it for high-speed inference.

## 4. Project "Helios": Optimal Liquidity Provision in Decentralized Markets

### 4.1. Vision and Goal

* **Name:** Helios, personifying the central, governing force of a system.
* **Strategic Goal:** To frame and solve the Uniswap v3 liquidity provision problem as a stochastic optimal control problem. This showcases the ability to apply rigorous quantitative methods to the new frontiers of decentralized finance (DeFi).

### 4.2. DeFi Mechanics and the Core Challenge

The project focuses on **Uniswap v3**, which introduced **concentrated liquidity**, allowing Liquidity Providers (LPs) to provide capital within specific price ranges. This increases capital efficiency but introduces the challenge of active management.

The core risk for LPs is **Impermanent Loss (IL)**, the opportunity cost that arises when the price of the assets in the pool diverges. This project reframes this problem through the lens of traditional finance:
* **An LP Position is a Short Volatility Position:** The payoff profile of a Uniswap LP is mathematically equivalent to selling an options straddle. The LP earns fees in low-volatility environments but suffers from IL in high-volatility environments.
* **This reframing is a game-changer.** The problem becomes one of optimally managing a portfolio of short-dated exotic options, making tools from derivatives trading (volatility analysis, dynamic hedging) the correct approach.

### 4.3. The Solution: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

The need to dynamically adjust the liquidity range to maximize fees while minimizing IL and transaction costs is a classic optimal control problem, perfectly suited for **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**.
* **Environment:** A custom-built Python simulator of a Uniswap v3 pool driven by historical price data.
* **Agent:** A DRL algorithm (e.g., PPO or SAC) that learns the optimal rebalancing policy.
* **State:** Observations like current price, historical volatility, the agent's current position, and network gas fees.
* **Action:** The new lower and upper bounds for the liquidity position (including a "do nothing" action).
* **Reward:** `Fees Earned - Impermanent Loss Incurred - Gas Costs`.

### 4.4. Development Roadmap

1.  **Phase 1 (AMM Simulator):** Build a discrete-time simulator of a Uniswap v3 pool in Python that accurately models swaps, fee accrual, and impermanent loss.
2.  **Phase 2 (Benchmark Strategies):** Implement and test simpler, static strategies (e.g., HODL, wide range, narrow range) to establish performance benchmarks.
3.  **Phase 3 (DRL Environment):** Wrap the simulator in an OpenAI `Gymnasium`-compatible API, defining the state/action spaces and reward logic.
4.  **Phase 4 (Train the DRL Agent):** Use a library like `Stable-Baselines3` to train a DRL agent in the custom environment.
5.  **Phase 5 (Analysis):** Rigorously evaluate the trained agent's dynamic strategy against the static benchmarks, creating visualizations of P&L, its components (fees vs. IL), and the agent's decisions.

#### Taxonomy of Impermanent Loss Mitigation Strategies

| Strategy Type | Specific Tactic | Mechanism | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Passive** | Use Stablecoin or Correlated Pairs | Selects assets with low relative price volatility. | Very low IL risk. | Low fee generation; vulnerable to de-pegging. |
| **Semi-Active** | Wider Price Ranges | Concentrates liquidity less aggressively. | Lower IL risk for a given price move. | Lower capital efficiency and fee income. |
| **Active** | Manual Rebalancing | Manually moves the position to follow the price. | Keeps liquidity active and earning fees. | Can realize losses repeatedly; high gas costs. |
| **Automated** | Use Rebalancing Protocols | Third-party smart contracts manage the position. | Hands-off management; gas efficiency. | Incurs fees; adds smart contract risk. |
| **DRL (Goal)** | Learn an Optimal Policy | Trains an AI agent to maximize risk-adjusted returns. | Potentially the most profitable; data-driven. | Extremely complex to implement. |
