## General Recommendations

- Use version control (GitHub) and clear documentation for each repo/module.
- Prioritize unit and integration testing from the start.
- Structure each repo for modularity so components (data, strategy, engine, analysis) can be reused in future projects.
- Plan for benchmarking and validation against standard references at every major step.

This skeleton and requirements roadmap gives you a solid, professional foundation for each project. You can now move forward with detailed design and development in dedicated threads for each module!
